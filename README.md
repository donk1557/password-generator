# password-generator

This program randomly generates a secure password to the benefit of the user. There are three functions that allow the program to do this. An image of the site is included in the repository.

Here is the link to the site: https://donk1557.github.io/password-generator/

## generatePassword
This function allows the user to customize the make-up of their password by being prompted to select specifications. There will always be at least one character contained in the password that meets each of the selected specifications.

## createPassword
This function randomly fills out the rest of the password to the number of characters specified earlier. 

## jumbleTumble
This function ensures that the password is purely random by mixing up the characters in the password an enumerate amount of times. The end result is then returned as the generated password.
